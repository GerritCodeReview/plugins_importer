      "message": "Regarding the hard coded value here: We should not rely on the number of changes returned by the couterpart. It might happen that there is a rather huge number is configured. In this case we might run into OutOfMemory issues when traversing the changes (observed during checks). So we have to set a limit which is considered to be not dangerous. We could also expose the limit to the user of the imported plugin, but in this cause it would be a parameter that is more the less hard to explain. What is the reviewers opinion here?",

      "message": "This and other adaptations to the permission backend change should only go to master (upcoming 2.15 release).\n\nWhat the gerrit customers need here, is a working version of this plugin for 2.14 release, obviously.\n\nThere is not much sense to create a stable-2.14 branch now, because the plugin doesn\u0027t compile and can\u0027t be even built, because Bazel driven build is not implemented.\n\nMy suggestion is: revert all adaptation for changes in gerrit API against master, make it compile and build and work against stale-2.14 branch, merged this change, create stable-2.14 branch and adapt on master for gerrit API 2.15 in follow-up change.",

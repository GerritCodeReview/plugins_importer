      "message": "I would rather move this method into an own utility class than factoring it out into a (common) superclass. Why? The utility methods from superclasses can only be used in their subclasses. Further, what if we need multiple utility methods and they are not all needed/used from every subclass? This would lead to an artificial class hierarchy derived from the utility method usage...",

This would not be possible when working with a utility class without common base class. May be it would be a good idea to share also other commonly used fields, like e.g. the user.",

      "message": "This also suffers from the same issue. While it works for a couple of commands soon we come to the situation where some commands need fields A,B some other commands need fields A,C and some others B,C (but not A). What would the a proper class hierarchy for this case? With Java\u0027s single inheritance I guess there is no a good solution.\n\nWhen we started this plugin I actually tried moving the common fields into base class(s) but gave up exactly because of this reason.",
